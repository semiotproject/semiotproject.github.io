This demo shows one of use-cases for SemIoT platform. Using multiple heterogenious data sources(such as online services of temperature observations [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com/) and [Narodmon](http://narodmon.ru/)), SemIoT platform allows to aggregate this data and use it in different scenarios. One of them - analysis of city temperature and temperature dynamic in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Driver for each of data sources regulary collect observations, normalize them using ontologies and store in the internal storage. Demo allows to view these microtrends in real-time and archive modes.
